Issue: [storybookjs/storybook/issues/21399](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/21399)<br/>
Storybook Version: `^7.0.0-rc.4`<br/>
PNPM Version: `^7.29.3`<br/>
Node Version: `18 LTS`<br/>
Builder: `vite`<br/>
Renderer: `react 18`

## Test Rig: Storybook in a Typical PNPM Monorepo

This repository mimics a typical integrated monorepo architecture where individual views or "micro front-ends" consume one or more centralized UI libraries. Build and test tooling (like storybook) live outside of that relationship to ensure weak coupling.

### How to run Storybook Issues Inspection

Clone and install

```bash
pnpm install
```

> _For install with empty cache, run_
>
> ```bash
> pnpm clean-install
> ```

then for the respective case...

### Expectation

After running `pnpx storybook@next init --builder vite`, official storybook features should "[just work...](https://youtu.be/P0hJm5v8TJw?t=1980)" without any additional configuration of loaders, builders or other down stream dependencies.

#### Case 1: Components inside storybook folder

```bash
pnpm run storybook:case_1
```

Components that are _inside_ of the storybook root folder (`../stories`) will:

- [x] For real files (`tools/stories/Component`)
  - [x] Render successfully in storybook
  - [x] Have JSDocs converted to story docs
  - [x] Have HMR show new stories files (while running, co-located `another.stories-hmr.tsx` to `.stories.tsx`)
- [ ] For symbolic links (`tools/stories/ComponentAsSymlink`)
  - [x] Render successfully in storybook
  - [ ] Have JSDocs converted to story docs
  - [ ] Have HMR show new stories files (while running, co-located `another.stories-hmr.tsx` to `.stories.tsx`)

---

#### Case 2-1: Components outside storybook folder

```bash
pnpm run storybook:case_2-1
```

Components that are _outside_ of the storybook root folder but referenced with a relative path (`../../ui/`) will:

- [x] Render successfully in storybook
- [ ] Have JSDocs converted to story docs
- [ ] Have HMR show new stories files (while running, co-located `another.stories-hmr.tsx` to `.stories.tsx`)

---

#### Case 2-2: Single capitalized component folder outside storybook

```bash
pnpm run storybook:case_2-2
```

A single component that is _outside_ of the storybook root folder but referenced with a relative path (`../../ui/Component`) to its _capitalized_ folder, will:

- [ ] Render successfully in storybook

#### Case 3: Components added to storybook from `pnpm` workspace

```bash
pnpm run storybook:case_3
```

Components that are _outside_ of the storybook root folder but referenced via `pnpm` workspaces, therefore located in `../node_modules/@repo/` as a symlink will:

- [ ] Render successfully in storybook

- [ ] Have HMR show new stories files (while running, co-located `another.stories-hmr.tsx` to `.stories.tsx`)
- [ ] Detects symlink recursion or provides easy way to exclude them

---

#### Case 4: Components via `pnpm` with globby workaround in `main.ts` to avoid `node_modules` recursion

```bash
pnpm run storybook:case_4
# or
pnpm run storybook
```

Components that are _outside_ of the storybook root folder but referenced via `pnpm` workspaces, ingested via a negative glob to avoid recursion as `../node_modules/@repo/**!(node_modules)/**!(node_modules)/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)` will:

- [x] Render successfully in storybook
- [ ] Have JSDocs converted to story docs
- [ ] Have HMR show new stories files (while running, co-located `another.stories-hmr.tsx` to `.stories.tsx`)
- [ ] Detects symlink recursion or provides easy way to exclude them
